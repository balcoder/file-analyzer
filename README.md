Api and Microservices Project - File Metadata Microservice
==========================================================

With a **responsive** form.

### User Stories

1.  I can submit a form object that includes a file upload.
2.  The from file input field has the "name" attribute set to "upfile". We rely on this in testing.
3.  When I click analyze, I will receive the file name, and size in bytes within the JSON response.

### Usage:

Click on Choose file and select the file you want the meta data on. Then click analyze.
